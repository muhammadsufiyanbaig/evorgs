## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### Type Safety Improvements
- Updated TypeScript types to handle null/empty data states
- Added proper type annotations (`any[]`, `any`, etc.) for temporary compatibility
- Added guard clauses to prevent runtime errors when data is null

### Error Prevention
- Added null checks before rendering data
- Implemented fallback UI messages for empty states
- Maintained component structure while removing dummy data

### GraphQL Integration Preparation
- Added TODO comments indicating where GraphQL queries should be implemented
- Preserved function signatures and component interfaces
- Maintained existing UI patterns for easy GraphQL integration

## 📊 **Data Removed Statistics**

| Category | Files Updated | Mock Objects Removed |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Public Services** | 1 | 6 service objects |
| **Vendor Services** | 4 | 15+ service/review objects |
| **Admin Users** | 1 | 10+ user/booking/voucher objects |
| **Admin Reviews** | 2 | 5+ review objects |
| **Admin Vouchers** | 3 | 20+ vendor/voucher objects |
| **Total** | **11 files** | **50+ mock objects** |

## 🎯 **Next Steps for GraphQL Integration**

Each updated file now contains TODO comments indicating where to:

1. **Add GraphQL Queries**: Replace mock data with `useQuery` hooks
2. **Implement Loading States**: Add loading spinners while data fetches
3. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries for failed queries
4. **Update Type Definitions**: Replace `any` types with proper GraphQL-generated types

## ✅ **Verification**

All files have been updated and are ready for GraphQL integration. The existing UI components and layouts remain intact, making it easy to connect real data from your GraphQL endpoint at `https://ev-orgs-server.vercel.app/graphql`.

The comprehensive GraphQL operations I previously integrated (in `/src/utils/graphql/`) can now be directly used to replace the removed dummy data with real service information.

**Status**: ✅ **Complete** - All dummy data successfully removed from service routes across Public, Vendor, and Admin sections.
